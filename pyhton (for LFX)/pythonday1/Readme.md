# ***A quick preview of day 1 of learning python *** :)

- **This is my first day of learning pyhton and also leaving the habit of "Ai ing" and starting a habit of "googling" my way to understand .** 

> **I am  bragging about not using "Ai" and will do for some time becasue i have a habit of " Ai ing " everything and i am develpoing a habit of not doing it and trying to create a cycle of self appriciation for not using it .** 

 ## ***The two resources i am following to help me along*** **üìö**
   - [w3Schools - Python documentation ] (https://www.w3schools.com/python/default/asp)
   - [official python documentation] (https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)
                                                
- ***pyhton documentation is hard to understand for me right now but trying***

## ***Things i learned on my first day :*** **üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**

1). **Python variable** _(bool,int,float,string)_  

2). **Python typecasting**    

3). **user inputs**    

4). **using {import math} and how to use** _[.e,.pi,.sqrt,.floor,.ceil]_

5). **using if , elif and else loops**

6). üì±**Simple Python calculator**

 - *There is a repetative use of num1 and num2 , which is i know seems wrong but i had to find my way to somehow break the if statement if someone entered the wrong operator choice.*

 - *Before using this the problem was that i was taking num1 and num2 unncessarily which will result in nothing becasue the operator was invalid.*

 - ***I was amazed to learn about " not in " becasue coming from a basic c++ background i was trying to figure out ** how i can make a if statement so that it picks up everything except "+","-","*","/"*** .

7).**‚öñÔ∏è** **Pyhton Weigth converter**

9).  **logical operators** _[and , or , not]_   


### 10). _Also created small stuffs like:_  
- **hypotanuis_calc  area_of_circle_calc**   -
- **rectangle_area_calc**    
- **shopping_cart_value_calc**  
- **circumference_calc.**
