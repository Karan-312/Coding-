**This is my first day of learning pyhton and also leaving the habit of "Ai ing" and starting a habit of "googling" my way to understand.

** I am bragning about not using "Ai" and will do for some time becasue i have a habit of " Ai ing " everything and i am develpoing a habit of not doing it and trying to create a cycle of self appriciation for not using it 

-> The two resources i am following to help me along are ->:https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp ( w3schools pyhton documentation)
                                                         ->:https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html( pyhton official documentation)
                                                         {pyhton documentation is hard to understand for me right now but trying }

** Things i learned on my first day are :

1). Python variable (bool,int,float,string)    

2). Python typecasting    

3). user inputs    

4). using {import math} and how to use [.e,.pi,.sqrt,.floor,.ceil]

5). using if , elif and else loops 

6).Simple Python calculator [https://github.com/Karan-312/Coding-/blob/main/pyhton%20(for%20LFX)/pythonday1/Python%20Calculator.py]

 -> There is a repetative use of num1 and num2 , which is i know seems wrong but i had to find my way to somehow break the if statement if someone entered the wrong operator choice.

 -> Before using this the problem was that i was taking num1 and num2 unncessarily which will result in nothing becasue the operator was invalid.

 -> I was amazed to learn about " not in " becasue coming from a basic c++ background i was trying to figure out ** how i can make a if statement so that it picks up everything except "+","-","*","/"** .

7). Pyhton Weigth converter [https://github.com/Karan-312/Coding-/blob/main/pyhton%20(for%20LFX)/pythonday1/weight_converter.py]


8). Python temp converter [https://github.com/Karan-312/Coding-/blob/main/pyhton%20(for%20LFX)/pythonday1/temp_converter.py]



9). logical operators [and , or , not ]   


10) and also created small stuffs like  hypotanuis_calc , area_of_circle_calc , rectangle_area_calc  , shopping_cart_value_calc , circumference_calc
